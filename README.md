# Heart-Disease-Detection
### Proejct at Nti Ai Summer Training 
In this project, I explored various machine learning and data preprocessing techniques including:
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
 ###### I implemented grid search for hyperparameter tuning and tackled class imbalance using oversampling techniques such as Random Oversampling and SMOTE. To enhance the model's robustness, I applied Z-score for outlier detection and managed multicollinearity among features. I also utilized Chi-square and p-values to highlight significant categorical features, and employed KNN to handle missing values.
